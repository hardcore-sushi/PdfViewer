Fork of GrapheneOS' [PdfViewer](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer) to work as a library.

## Warning !
The only goal of this library is to be integrated in [DroidFS](https://forge.chapril.org/hardcoresushi/DroidFS). Use it at your own risk !

The npm dependency has been removed. Instead, `pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js` must be manually placed in `app/pdfjs-dist/build/`.
